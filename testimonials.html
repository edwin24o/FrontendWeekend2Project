<h3>REAL VOICES THAT MATTER :</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cable - "Working with Wade is like handling a live grenade. He's unpredictable, dangerous, and somehow... useful. Despite his constant chatter and reckless methods, the guy gets results. Just don't expect a quiet, professional mission with him around."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Domino - "Deadpool? Well, let's just say his chaos works in our favor... most of the time. I mean, it’s lucky to have someone who can survive anything, right? He’s got a weird charm, and I’ll admit, he can be a decent teammate when he's not blowing things up or talking too much shi#."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Gambit - "Wade is... how you say? Très bizarre. His humor is all over the place, but you can't deny he has heart—beneath all that madness and mercenary stuff. Plus, anyonecrazyenough to take on amissionwith no chance of survival has earned my respect."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Blade - "Wade? The guy’s batshi# crazy and stupid is an understatment, but he knows how to handle himself in a fight. We don’t always see eye to eye especially when it comes to keeping a low profile but I’ll admit, he’s saved my neck more times than I care to count maybe not many but you get it."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>X-23 (Laura Kinney) - "He's reckless and loud, but he's also loyal—sometimes to a fault. I’ve fought alongside him enough to know he can handle himself, but I still don’t get how he can heal from the craziest injuries and keep going. He's annoying... but you can count on him in a fight."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Wolverine (Logan) - "Yeah, Wade's an idiot and loud one too, but when it came down to it he was hope I couldn't be, I didn't trust him at first but he changed me.Don’t get me wrong, I’d still rather beat the shi# out of him than work with him, but the guy can pull through when it matters. Just wish he'd keep the fourth-wall-breaking to himself. And the jokes.."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Elektra - "Deadpool is a wildcard. His fighting skills are undeniable, but his unpredictability and constant jokes make working with him... challenging. That said, when it comes down to it, he's willing to face impossible odds for the right cause. Just don’t ask me to enjoy his company."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Colossus - "Wade is my... comrade, though I do not always agree with his methods. He is brash and lacks discipline, but beneath his chaotic exterior, there is a good heart. He has shown time and time again that he will fight for what is right, even if he does it in his own, unpredictable way."</li>
    
    <br>

    <li>Negasonic Teenage Warhead - "Deadpool is like a walking meme. He’s annoying, loud, and can’t stop talking... but I guess I kinda like having him around. His healing factor means he’s basically invincible, which is good because he’s the first to throw himself into danger. Plus, he’s not afraid to take a hit—literally."</li>
