        <article>
            Born as Wade Winston Wilson in Canada (eh!), I had a rough childhood filled with sarcasm, sass, and questionable life choices. Fast forward to me getting diagnosed with terminal cancer. Long story short, I agreed to some experimental treatments under shady circumstances, which gave me a healing factor, scarred my pretty face (tragic, I know), and turned me into the testical looking, wisecracking hero we all love today!

        <h3 class="b2">Becoming Deadpool (HOT!!)</h3>
        <article>
            After surviving a torturous experiment (they really weren’t great hosts), I became Deadpool a tigth red-suited, katana wielding, gun toting, world saving mercenary with a mouth. My healing powers mean I can't die trust me, I've tried and I’ve since made it my mission to save the world... or get paid. Depends on my mood, really. One thing’s for sure: I’m here to make things FUN. Fourth wall? What’s that? 
            <br><br>
            Now I fight bad guys (sometimes the good guys, too), eat chimichangas, and occasionally stop by Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters just to annoy Wolverine. It’s a fulfilling life.
