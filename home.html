        Join me friends, through my life, skills, and god damn bloody resume. You'll find my outrageous and encouraging bio, filled with ridiculous accomplishments, and some testimonials (most of them threats) from enemies and teammates (most of them dead). There's also a contact page if you want concact me PERSONALLY or perhaps you'd like to schedule a personal date (I'm Vegan on Sundays). If I am enough to hire... Avengers (mainly Thor❤️) I'm looking at you ;)!
